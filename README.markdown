Anti-frameworky boilerplatish'ness.

Just putting some generic reusable logic into git hub for easy pull.

This is about as frameworky as i'll like it.

I promise not to make you use it.

####Temporary Assumptions
* OS is Debian'ish
* HTTP server is /etc/apache2
* Application root directory is in /var/www

As I learn PHP I'm just pulling over application concepts from other environments. Inspired by [html5-boilerplate](http://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate) .... I'll have to dig in there for more inspiration :)
