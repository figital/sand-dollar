anti-frameworky boilerplatishness

just putting some generic reusable logic into git hub for easy pull.

this is about as frameworky as i'll like it.

i promise not to make you use it.

####temporary assumptions
* os is debian'ish
* http server is /etc/apache2
* application root directory is in /var/www

as i learn php i'm just pulling over app concepts from other environs. inspired by [html5-boilerplate](http://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate) .... i'll have to dig in there for more inspiration :)
